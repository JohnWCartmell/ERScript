      Khipus (or quipus) were structured systems of knots used by the Inca people to communicate and record 
      numerical records. A relatively small number of khipus survived the Spanish conquest of 
      South America and by and large are now held in museums. Structural details of each of these khipus have been 
      described in a database by the Khipu Database Project<footnote>See the Khipu Database Project: http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/ProjectDescrERD.html.</footnote>. I have drawn the entity model shown here to describe this structure.
      You can think of this model as a modern meta description of an ancient database system.

        This model is adapted from a model of Khipu  presented by the Khipu database 
        project and used to 
        describe the data tables held in their database.
