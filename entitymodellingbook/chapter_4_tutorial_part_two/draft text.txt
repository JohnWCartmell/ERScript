Text for end of overview page "Tutorial Part Two - Representing Data"

I give you the challenge, as I have given myself, of understanding and articulating
entity modelling and the whole business of representation 
of the world in data  from first principles and without reliance, recourse or reference
to any particular technology - neither any programming language nor any database system.
I wish, as a happy consequence, for you to be successful finding more patterns in your data 
to exploit in database design and software development. 

If you follow this tutorial and at the end view this whole business a little bit differently
to before then I have achieved what  I set out to in writing it.
