** Folder <DISTRIBUTION>/conceptualExamples **

This folder contains ER models used as examples on John Cartmell's  www.entitymodelling.org website.

We classify the entity models included here as 'conceptual' because they do not not qualify as logical data models - they are fragments of such and, for example, do not generally include specifications of identifying attributes and relationships. 

Both svg and latex can be built from these examples from the windows command line.
