** Folder <DISTRIBUTION>/conceptualExamples **

This folder contains ER models used as examples on John Cartmell's  www.entitymodelling.org website.

We classify the entity models included here as 'conceptual' because they do not not qualify as logical data models - they are fragments of such and, for example,
do not generally include specifications of identifying attributes and relationships. 

In a Microsoft Windows environment the following scripts are available:

  <DISTRIBUTION>\<ERHOME>\scripts\genSvg can be used to generate or regenerate a diagram xxxx.svg in the docs subfolder from the ERmodel source xxxx.xml.

  <DISTRIBUTION>\<ERHOME>\scripts\genAllSvg may be used to generate all such diagrams in a single command.
