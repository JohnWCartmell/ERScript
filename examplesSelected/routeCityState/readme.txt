I wanted have all diagrams as presentations of routeCityState..logical.xml

I am thwarted though because I want  diagram routeCityStatePaths.xml which has 
two diagram nodes both representing entity type city. One named "city" and one named "city ".
This cannot be a view of routeCityState..logical (as far as I can see).

Create routeCityCityStateRoute..logical.xml by editing a copy of routeCityState..logical.
Create routeCityCityStateRoute..topdown..diagram.xml
and    routeCityCityStateRoute..leftright..diagram.xml.
