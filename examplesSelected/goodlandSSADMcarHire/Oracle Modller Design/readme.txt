I created a version of this entity model in Oracle Dta Modeler.
From within Oracle Data Modeler I printed as file GoodlandSSADMcarHireLogical.svg.
I then used Inkscape to open Logical.svg and save as GoodlandSSADMcarHireLogical.eps.

I was able to use the latex package epsf and the command \epsfbox to render the diagram
in my latex in the document which is the book and uses pstricks. 

I have not included any of this process in the build.

I shall take the eps and copy it into the book hand crafted images folder if I decide to use this.
