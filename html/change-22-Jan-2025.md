Enable the use of the  presentation of dependencies as reference relationships.

### Rationale
So that multiple presentations of subsets of the same logical model can be made with some depedencies drawn left to right as if dependencies. Want to share the logical model especially relationship ids and
the identifying flags.

### Implementation

### Testing

1. Restructure the source of existing diagrams in the theDramaticArts folder in examplesSelected so that relationship ids have a single source.
2. Create identificationScheme diagrams for entities such as role and production which do not already have them.
