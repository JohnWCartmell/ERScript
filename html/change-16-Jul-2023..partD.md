## 16 July 2023 Part D Updates to ERmodel2.svg.xslt.

### Rationale 
Update update text auto-generated into the pop-up.

### Summary
1. In the pop up for a compostion relationship offer a "See also" to pop up the info for the destination type of the relationship.
For example in the pullback compostion relationship append: 
```
<p>
See also <button id="E26" class="popout">Pullback</button>
</p>
```
2. Don't offer this in the case of a relationship whose src type equals destination type.

3. In the pop up for an abstract entity type offer a "See also" and a list of  buttons to pop up the info for the concrete subtypes type.
