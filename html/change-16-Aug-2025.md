er2flex diagramming ---  New naming conventions for source files of ER diagrams
and adding flex tuning files to each selected example.
The filenames are to reflect that a diagram is a model plus some flex diagram tuning instructions 
--- these fine tune the diagram produced automatically for er2flex --- and that the original format for diagram presentation is now considered legacy code.

### Overview
Implement new file naming conventions for producing ER diagrams using er2flex.

Change all selected examples and add tuning files to all these examples.

Implement a new variant of the script er2flex2svg.ps1 to support the new filename conventions. 
Name this new script er2svg.ps1.

### File names
The cricket selected example is typical. Currently there are the following files

  + cricketMatch..logical.xml
  + cricketMatch..presentation.xml
  + cricketMatch..diagram.xml
  + cricketMatch..physical..diagram.xml

Rename the latter three files        

  + cricketMatch..legacyPresentation.xml
  + cricketMatch..legacyDiagram.xml
  + cricketMatch..physical..legacyDiagram.xml *currently, this is either relational or hierarchical physical*

To these I need add

  + cricketMatch..flexTuning.xml *containing flex diagramming scripting to fine tune the diagram generated by er2flex*
  + cricketMatch..diagram.xml *just includes two files cricketMatch..flexTuning.xml and cricketMatch..logical.xml*
  + cricketMatch..physical..diagram.xml *just includes two files cricketMatch..flexTuning.xml and cricketMatch..physical.xml. This latter file is generated in the build area.*

### Upshot
The following .svg (and like .html) diagrams will be produced:
+ cricketMatch..legacyDiagram.svg
+ cricketMatch..physical..legacyDiagram.svg
+ cricketMatch..logical.svg   *this is the flex diagram produced for the logical model*
+ cricketMatch..diagram.svg   *this is a manually adjusted version of the flex diagram for the logical model*
+ cricketMatch..physicalDiagram.svg *this is a manually adjusted version of the flex diagram for the physical model*

### er2svg.ps1
To support these filename changes produce a variant of the script et2flex.svg.ps1 named er2svg.ps1
and use this script from selected examples build.ps1 files.


### html/index
Modify html/index.html to use the new filenames and to have links to legacy and tuned and untuned er2flex diagrams.
