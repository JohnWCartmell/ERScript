flex diagramming --- support for UML class diagrams
### Description
Add support  for diamond and triangular markers.

? Add support in the flex meta model for demarcation of headers of the boxes that representi classes. 
? Add support for routes implemented without orthogonal start and end arms.

### Analysis
Once new markers exist for markers than can probably skecth a UML diagram using existing primitives of flex diagrams.
Maybe should make them easier to build and maybe eventually have UML-style as an option on er 2 flex.

### Implementation
1.  This is a bit rubbish but we need to add the markers to flexDiagramming/xslt/diagram1.svg.xslt.
Oh well, never mind. Add markers for hollowDiamond, solidDiamond and hollowTriangle.


2. Add a UML flex examples as folder flexDiagramming/examples. Into this folder
copy the flex diagram generated by the selected example as shlaerMellorDeptStudentProfessor0..logical.flex.xml 
 and edit it to be in UML style.

Will need specify line endings for routes, such as
   ```
         <source>
            ...
            <endline>
               <marker>hollowDiamond</marker>
            </endline>
         </source>
```
### Testing
As described above.
