** Folder <DISTRIBUTION>/exampleDataModels **

This folder contains ER models used in testing code generation and in some cases used as examples on John Cartmell's  www.entitymodelling.org website.

These models are intended to be transformed to physical models using the logical2physical transform.
 
In a Microsoft Windows environment the following scripts are available:

  <DISTRIBUTION>\<ERHOME>\scripts\genSvg can be used to generate or regenerate a diagram xxxx.svg in the docs subfolder from the ERmodel source xxxx.xml.

  <DISTRIBUTION>\<ERHOME>\scripts\genAllSvg may be used to generate all such diagrams in a single command.
