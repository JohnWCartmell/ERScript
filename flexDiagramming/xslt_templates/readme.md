Files in this folder are templates that contain placeholder varaibles which are then preprocessed to produce executable templates.
WE use two sets of substitutions the first for the x dimension the second for the y dimension.
The following placeholders and substitutions are used 
| placeholder| substitution 1 | substitution 2 |      
|  -------- | -------- | -------- |
| xP        | x      | y      |
| wP        | w      | h      |
| wlP       | wl     | ht     |
| wrP       | wr     | hb     |
| leftP     | left   | top    |
| rightP    | right  | bottom |
| centreP   | centre | middle |

consider having P's for priorities to because
when originally y file was hand edited :
  Changed priority 50 to 30
  Changed priority 51 to 31
